Document conventions
====================

Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
descriptive assertions and [RFC2119]_ terminology. The key words
"MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative
parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC2119]_. However, for readability, these words do not appear in all
uppercase letters in this specification.

All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. Examples in
this specification are introduced with the words "for example".


Chunk encoding/decoding with Blosc
==================================

@@TODO define how chunks are encoded and decoded
@@TODO be sure to clarify that the encoded data should conform to the Blosc file format

Chunks are encoded and decoded using the compression algorithm implemented in the
`C-Blosc library version 1 <https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc>`_ or
`C-Blosc library version 2 <https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2>`_,
and encoded data should be stored as it is to file.

The compression level is an integer from 0 to 9 which controls the speed and
level of compression. A level of 1 is the fastest compression method and
produces the least compression, while 9 is slowest and produces the most
compression. Compression is turned off completely when level is 0.

The shuffling method is an integer from -1 to 2 which controls the way bytes or
bits are rearranged, which can lead to a greater compression.
A value of 1 performs byte-wise shuffling, and a value of 2 performs bit-wise
shuffling. If a value of -1 is given, then default shuffling is used:
- bit-wise shuffle will be used for buffers with itemsize 1,
- byte-wise shuffle will be used otherwise.

Shuffling is turned off completely when the method value is 0.

The size in bytes of the compressed blocks is an integer value which defaults
to 0, in which case an automatic size will be used.


Configuring codec in array metadata
===================================

@@TODO define how to specify in array metadata documents.

The Blosc codec can be specified as a compressor for a Zarr array under the
``compressor`` name in the corresponding array metadata document. The URI for
the Blosc codec defined in this specification is
https://purl.org/zarr/spec/codecs/blosc/1.0.

Additionally, the compression level and the shuffling method must be specified
in the ``configuration`` metadata name:

- the compression level value is given by the ``clevel`` name.
- the shuffling method value is given by the ``shuffle`` name (optional).
- the size of the compressed blocks is given by the ``blocksize`` name
  (optional).

For example, the array
metadata document below specifies a Blosc codec configured with a compression
level of 1 and a byte-wise shuffling::


    {
        "compressor": {
            "codec": "https://purl.org/zarr/spec/codecs/blosc/1.0",
            "configuration": {
                "clevel": 1,
                "shuffle": 2
            }
        },
    }
